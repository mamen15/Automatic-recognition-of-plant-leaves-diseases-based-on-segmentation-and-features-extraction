# Automatic recognition of plant leaves diseases based on segmentation and features extraction
Our project involves implementing and testing a preprocessing, segmentation, and feature extraction method for a plant disease recognition system. The feature extraction phase, also known as primitive or characteristic extraction, is crucial to represent the input data (images of diseased plants to be recognized) as a fixed dimension vector of primitives.

We are working in pairs on this project, and we rely on the attached documents to design and implement our solution. Our goal is to create an effective and accurate plant disease recognition system using the latest techniques in image processing and machine learning.
